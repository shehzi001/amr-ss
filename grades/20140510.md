Feedback

You misinterpreted the "skip unreachable" flag. When it is set, you are supposed to skip the unreachable pose and go to the next one. When it is set to false, you are supposed to stop the path execution when a pose is unreachable. You inverted this behaviour. But this is just a minor thing and I will not reduce the grade because of it. Just correct it please.

The implementation works very well. Nice job on that!

The test cases make sense. Too bad the automated test node does not actually test the path executor. Instead it runs the test without waiting for results (the old paths get preempted after a certain time period). We cannot give full points for this, but the structure of the test node seems to be ok.
