You did not use the provided method to convert coordinates to cell coordinates. 
The method does a similar thing like what you do but you forgot the lround() step.

This part of the code seems to be error prone
```
  if (distance >= max_range) { distance = max_range * 2; }
```
You could have capped the distance instead of changing it. This has a bad effect on the free map.
