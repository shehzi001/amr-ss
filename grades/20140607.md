Your implementation of a low overall weight firewall is to kill all particles with low weight. This is generally a good idea, but instead you could have just added a number of random particles every round, as was advised. This way you would increase the robustness of your approach by a lot.

You resampling step is erroneous, as you do not start the roulette wheel with a random number, which is the basis for the approach.
